CHALLENGE:
Difficulty: "Expert"
Description: "Create a regex that validates balanced parentheses (this is tricky as regular expressions typically can't count)."
Samples: Match: "()"; Match: "(())"; Match: "()()()"; NonMatch: "("; NonMatch: ")()"; NonMatch: "(()"
END_CHALLENGE

SOLUTION:
Regex: "^(?:[^()]*\((?:[^()]*\)[^()]*\()*[^()]*\)[^()]*)*$"
Explanation: "This is a complex regex that attempts to match balanced parentheses. It works for simple cases but has limitations, as true parenthesis matching requires a context-free grammar, not a regular expression. It uses nested groups to match pairs of parentheses."
