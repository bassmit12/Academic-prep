CHALLENGE:
Difficulty: "Hard"
Description: "Create a regex that matches valid IPv4 addresses."
Samples: Match: "192.168.1.1"; Match: "10.0.0.1"; Match: "255.255.255.255"; NonMatch: "256.0.0.1"; NonMatch: "192.168.1"; NonMatch: "192.168.1.1.1"

SOLUTION:
Regex: "^((25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.){3}(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)$"
Explanation: "This regex matches each octet of an IPv4 address, ensuring each number is between 0 and 255. It uses a group for the first three octets (with a dot after each) and then matches the final octet."
