CHALLENGE:
Difficulty: "Easy"
Description: "Create a regex that matches strings starting with 'A' and ending with 'Z'."
Samples: Match: "AZ"; Match: "ABCZ"; Match: "A123Z"; NonMatch: "ABC"; NonMatch: "BAZ"; NonMatch: "az"
END_CHALLENGE

SOLUTION:
Regex: "^A.*Z$"
Explanation: "This regex uses ^ to match the start of the string, followed by 'A'. The .* matches zero or more of any character, and Z$ ensures the string ends with 'Z'."
