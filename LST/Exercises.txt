Exercise 6:
  A:
  If we take X which is a subset of B and a subset of A then
  So X is in both A and B 
  x is in A ∩ B 
  So every element of C is also an element of A ∩ B
  True

  B:
  If C is a subset of the intersection of A and B then C must be a subset of A aswell as both
  True 

Exercise 7:
  A:
  A = {1, 2}
  B = {3,4}
  C = {1, 2, 3, 4}
  
  So C is the union of A and B but C is not a subset of A and not a subset of B since elements are missing
  False

  B:
  A = {1, 2}
  B = {1}
  C = {1, 2, 3}
  
  False because the union of A and B can miss an element as shown above which makes this statement False

  C:
  A = {1, 2}
  B = {3, 4}
  C= {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

  A Can be a subset of C and B can be a subset of C therefor this is True

Exercise 8:
  A:
  A = {1, 2}
  B = {1, 2, 3}

  A is a subset of B 
  Union of A and B = B 
  True 

  B:
  A = {1, 2}
  B = {1, 2, 3}

  A is a subset of B 
  Intersection of A and B = A 
  True 

  C:
  A = {1, 2}
  
  A is the intersection and union of A so 
  True 

  D: 
  The intersection of A and empty set can only be empty set because no elements are in empty set 
  True

  E: 
  The union of A and empty sets is A because empty set does not contain any elements that are not in A 
  True 

Exercise 9:
  A:

  B: 

Exercise 10:
  A:
  A ∩ (B ∪ C) -> Distributive law 
  (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C) 
  True

  B: 
  Same law as above
  True

Exercise 11:
  Yes Distributive law

Exercise 12:
  A:
  True

  B: 
  Universe

Exercise 13:
 A:
 (A ∩ B)^c -> DeMorgan
 (A^c ∪ B^c)

 B: 
 Same as above use DeMorgan

Exercise 14:

Exercise 15:
  Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {3, 4, 5}.

  Then, A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, A ∩ B = {3}, |A| = 3, and |B| = 3.

  Now, | A ∪ B | + | A ∩ B | = 5 + 1 = 6.

  However, |A| + |B| = 3 + 3 = 6.

  So, | A ∪ B | + | A ∩ B | ≠ |A| + |B|

Exercise 16:
  (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ B^c) -> Distributive
  A ∩ (B ∪ B^c) Complement
  A ∩ U -> Identity
  A 

  So True

Exercise 17:
  A:
  A = 3

  B:
  2^A =
  2^3 =
  8
  
  C:
  P(A)={{},{{0}},{{0,1}},{{0,{0,1}}},{{0},{0,1}},{{0},{0,{0,1}}},{{0,1},{0,{0,1}}},{{0},{0,1},{0,{0,1}}}}

  D:
  Yes

  E: 
  no 

  F: 
  No 

Exercise 18:

Exercise 19:
  A: True
  B: False
  C: True 
  D: False

Exercise 20:
  (2x, x+y)=(6,2)

  2x = 6
  x = 3

  3 + y = 2
  y = -1

Exercise 21:
  Uniqueness: Each element in the domain (P in this case) can only map to one element in the codomain (Q in this case).
  Order matters: The order of elements in the domain matters and should be reflected in the order of their mapped elements in the codomain.

  A: False
  B: False 
  C: False
  D: False
  E: True 
  F: False
  G: True 

Exercise 22:
  P x P  Q
 (1, 1)  (a)
 (1, 2)  (b)
 (2, 1)
 (2, 2)

 A: False
 B: False 
 C: True 
 D: False 

Exercise 23:
 A: True
 B: False
 C: False

Exercise 24:
  Not a function because this violates Uniqueness

  A: Domain = {1, 2, 3}
  B: Range = {a, b, c}

Exercise 25:
  A: Function for Domain ℝ but not 0 and Range ℝ but not 0
  B: Function with domain and range for all positive numbers
  C: Function with domain and range for all positive numbers
  D: Function for domain all positive numbers and range ℝ
  E: Function for domain and range of ℕ
  F: Function for domain and range of Z
  G: Function for Z except {-1, 0, 1}

Exercise 26:
  A:
  Range Domain = R R 
  Inverse Domain range = R R

  y = 3x + 1
  x = (y-1)/3
