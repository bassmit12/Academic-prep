Exercise 6:
  A:
  If we take X which is a subset of B and a subset of A then
  So X is in both A and B 
  x is in A ∩ B 
  So every element of C is also an element of A ∩ B
  True

  B:
  If C is a subset of the intersection of A and B then C must be a subset of A aswell as both
  True 

Exercise 7:
  A:
  A = {1, 2}
  B = {3,4}
  C = {1, 2, 3, 4}
  
  So C is the union of A and B but C is not a subset of A and not a subset of B since elements are missing
  False

  B:
  A = {1, 2}
  B = {1}
  C = {1, 2, 3}
  
  False because the union of A and B can miss an element as shown above which makes this statement False

  C:
  A = {1, 2}
  B = {3, 4}
  C= {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

  A Can be a subset of C and B can be a subset of C therefor this is True

Exercise 8:
  A:
  A = {1, 2}
  B = {1, 2, 3}

  A is a subset of B 
  Union of A and B = B 
  True 

  B:
  A = {1, 2}
  B = {1, 2, 3}

  A is a subset of B 
  Intersection of A and B = A 
  True 

  C:
